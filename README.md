# simplyWeather

## Project Info
The project can be viewed at [simplyWeather.](https://tpanzini.github.io/Weather_App/)

simplyWeather is a minimalist weather app that displays the current weather conditions and the weather conditions of the next 4 days.

Depending on the weather conditions, the following elements will change:
* The weather icon will change to reflect the current conditions (i.e. rain, clouds, sun, etc) and time of day (i.e. sun vs moon).
* The background color will change based on the same 2 factors above.
* If the weather is looked up after sunrise, then the color of the background will change based on the weather conditions (i.e. light blue for sunny, dark grey for cloudy, etc).
* If the weather is looked up after sunset, the background will load as a very dark grey, regardless of the weather conditions.

The goal of this project was to create a simple weather app that anyone could use.

## Technologies

# How to Use
Simply type in the name of the city you are looking for (i.e. Seattle, Boston, etc) and the app will return the weather of the desired location. 

The search bar will remain at the top of the screen at all times in order to search the next city.
